Client: Is he attracted to me or just being friendly?

Tarot Reader: For your question, I pulled the 7 of Pentacles. This card is about nurturing something and expecting something great, something new, to come out of it. When it comes to your question, I feel as though they are attracted to you and they view you as someone who they could potentially be with romantically. They seem to be interested in nurturing this connection, this can be them wanting to put more time and effort into the relationship with you. At the bottom of the deck for the overall energy was the Two of Cups, a card of balance. Showing that they do not want to just take from this connection, but they also want to give. Ultimately, I feel like they are attracted to you and they are curious over where this connection will go in the future. They are open to exploring romance with you in the future but I feel they are not rushing it.


Much love to you~
