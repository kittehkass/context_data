Client: Should I apply for the analytics masters degree program and become a data scientist?

Tarot Reader: For your question, I pulled the Ten of Pentacles and having this card come out is a great sign as this card represents abundance and stability. This is already showing a path that will lead you toward great success with hard work and determination. At the bottom of the deck for the overall energy was the Queen of Swords, this is someone who gets the job done even though challenges may arise. This path will require a lot of confidence so make sure it is truly something you want to go after. One thing that came through, and the reason why I mentioned confidence, is that pursuing that degree will be stressful at first. With these cards appearing, I do believe applying for this program will be very beneficial to you in the long run. 


Much love to you~
