Client: When will you meet the man I mentioned in your previous reading?


Tarot Reader: For your question, I pulled the Ace of Wands and this card represents a fast moving energy that is close to coming in. I do believe I picked up something similar in your reading. The coloring of the card also drew me in and I started to think about trees changing color and I feel that this will be happening right after you two meet. When it comes to a specific timeframe, I was being pulled towards the end of Summer around September. The Strength card at the bottom of the deck can signify using this time to follow certain goals in your life as I feel that doing so will end up leading you towards each other. Ultimately, I feel as though a passionate connection will be coming in relatively soon, and this shows someone that may be a bit challenging. With this energy, the challenges that appear will cause long term personal growth, being beneficial for yourself and this connection.




Much love to you~
