Q: Why did Jeffrey block and unblock you on Instagram?


A: For your question, I pulled the Hermit card and this card can show a period of isolation. When it comes to your question, this could mean that they are feeling lonely and I’m getting the sense that they are slightly a bit bored. With the Two of Pentacles at the bottom of the deck for the overall energy, this gives me the feeling that they are feeling indecisive and that they want to communicate with you but they are feeling insecure at this moment in time. I feel as though they randomly blocked you due to feeling lonely, which doesn’t make much sense but it feels like if they blocked you, then they have a reason to feel that way. Then I feel as though they regretted it and thought, “why did I just do that?” Leading to them unblocking you. Ultimately, I feel like Jeremy wants to distance himself at times but then another part of him doesn’t want to do that. They are feeling quite confused over where it will all go in the future.


Much love to you~
